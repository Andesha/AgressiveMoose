# Brock University COSC 3P98 Graphics Project
Once upon a time this was a course project that was used to teach modern OpenGL, shaders, and get a better handle on actual C++ that wasn't just numerical methods. It was a lot of work. A lot.

Thanks to the Lizard Wizard for helping us fix the production issues.
